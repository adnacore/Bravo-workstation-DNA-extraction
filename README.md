# Bravo-workstation-DNA-extraction
This repository contains the electronic protocol files for the Automated DNA Extraction in 5M40 extraction buffer for automated liquid handling on the Bravo NGS workstation B in 96-well format. The method was developed primarily for ancient DNA research. It provides the following electronic protocols:
# Requirements
To use the protocol, a Bravo NGS workstation is required. Calibration of the instrument for this protocol has to be performed by the user and requires significant expertise in using the platform.
# Documentation
A brief description of the steps performed by the liquid handling system is provided for each protocol in the docs/ directory, potentially providing a framework for setting the method up on liquid handling systems from other manufacturers. Some of the instructions, for example regarding the documentation and location of files, are specific to the environment and workflows of the Ancient DNA Core Unit of the MPI-EVA and have to be amended in other environments.
